# 3. If μ= 55, σ₄ₐ= 4, σ₄ᵦ=10, σ₄𝒸= 15, In this which is better

## 1. Introduction 

In a Normal Distribution, the **mean (μ)** determines the center of the distribution, while the **standard deviation (σ)** determines the spread or dispersion of data around the mean.

When multiple distributions have the same mean but different standard deviations, the difference lies in how widely the data values are distributed.

---

## 2. Given Data 

Mean (μ) = 55

Standard Deviations:

* σ₄ₐ = 4
* σ₄ᵦ = 10
* σ₄𝒸 = 15

All three distributions are centered at 55 but differ in spread.

---

## 3. Role of Standard Deviation

Standard deviation measures how much the data deviates from the mean.

* Smaller σ → Data is closely clustered around the mean
* Larger σ → Data is widely spread

Thus, σ controls the width and height of the bell-shaped curve:

* Small σ → Narrow and tall curve
* Large σ → Wide and flat curve

---

## 4. Analysis of Each Distribution 

### Case 1: σ₄ₐ = 4

* Very small spread
* Data points are highly concentrated near 55
* Distribution is narrow and sharply peaked
* Indicates high consistency

Range within 1σ:
55 − 4 = 51
55 + 4 = 59

Most values lie between 51 and 59.

---

### Case 2: σ₄ᵦ = 10

* Moderate spread
* Data is reasonably distributed around the mean
* Balanced variability

Range within 1σ:
55 − 10 = 45
55 + 10 = 65

Most values lie between 45 and 65.

---

### Case 3: σ₄𝒸 = 15

* Large spread
* Data widely dispersed from the mean
* Distribution is flat and broad
* Indicates high variability

Range within 1σ:
55 − 15 = 40
55 + 15 = 70

Values are more scattered.

---

## 5. Graphical Interpretation 

If plotted on a graph:

* σ = 4 → Tall and narrow curve
* σ = 10 → Moderately wide curve
* σ = 15 → Very wide and flat curve

As σ increases, the curve becomes flatter and more spread out.

## 7. Which is Better? 

The better distribution depends on the objective.

If the goal is:

* Greater stability
* Higher consistency
* Less variability
* More reliable performance

Then the distribution with the smallest standard deviation is preferable.

Therefore,

**σ₄ₐ = 4 is the best choice**, because it shows the least dispersion and highest concentration around the mean.

---

## 8. Conclusion 

Although all three distributions share the same mean (55), their variability differs significantly. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data values are closely clustered around the mean, leading to better predictability and consistency.

Hence, among the given options, the distribution with **σ₄ₐ = 4** is the most stable and reliable. Larger standard deviations (10 and 15) represent increased dispersion and reduced consistency.

Thus, when evaluating distributions with the same mean, the one with the smallest standard deviation is generally considered better if stability and precision are required.
