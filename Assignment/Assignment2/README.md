## 1. Introduction

In statistics and data science, many real-world phenomena follow a **Normal Distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian Distribution**.

A Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is:

- Symmetrical  
- Bell-shaped  
- Centered around the mean  
- Defined by Mean (μ) and Standard Deviation (σ)  

It is widely used in fields such as education, healthcare, finance, and quality control.

## 2. Selected Domain: Students’ Examination Scores

For this assignment, we consider the domain of **students’ examination marks**.

In a large class:

- Most students score around the average.  
- Few students score extremely high or extremely low.  
- The distribution of marks forms a bell-shaped curve.  

This makes student performance a suitable real-world example of a Normal Distribution.

## 3. Parameters of the Distribution

Assume:

- Mean (μ) = 70 marks  
- Standard Deviation (σ) = 10 marks  

This means:

- The average score of students is 70.  
- Most students' marks are spread around 70.  
- The standard deviation indicates how far marks deviate from the mean.

## 4. Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

The **Empirical Rule** explains how data is distributed in a normal distribution.

According to this rule:

- **68%** of values lie within μ ± 1σ  
- **95%** of values lie within μ ± 2σ  
- **99.7%** of values lie within μ ± 3σ  

For our example:

- μ − 1σ = 60  
- μ + 1σ = 80  

- μ − 2σ = 50  
- μ + 2σ = 90  

- μ − 3σ = 40  
- μ + 3σ = 100  

This means:

- **68%** of students score between **60 and 80**.  
- **95%** score between **50 and 90**.  
- **99.7%** score between **40 and 100**.

## 5. Graphical Representation

The horizontal axis represents **Marks**, and the vertical axis represents **Number of Students (Frequency)**.

The graph forms a symmetric bell-shaped curve centered at **μ = 70**.

## 6. Importance of Normal Distribution in This Domain

- Helps in analyzing student performance  
- Identifies average performers and outliers  
- Assists in grading systems  
- Useful in academic data analysis and decision-making

## 7. Conclusion

The Normal Distribution provides a mathematical model to understand how student marks are distributed around the average. The Empirical Rule clearly explains the percentage of students falling within specific score ranges.

In the domain of examination analysis, this distribution helps educators evaluate overall class performance, detect anomalies, and implement fair grading policies.

Thus, the Normal Distribution and Empirical Rule together form an essential statistical foundation for analyzing real-world data.
